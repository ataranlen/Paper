Subject: [PATCH] Sync position on teleportation

We've seen many a cases where the "last good" x/y/z is desynced from
the x/y/z that is checked for moving too fast.

Theory is that when you have multiple movement packets queued up,
and the player is teleported after the first then the 2nd and 3rd come in,
it is triggering a massive movement velocity.

This will ensure that the servers position is synchronized anytime player is teleported.
